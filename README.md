# Stream Deck+ Volume Dial — Rollup + TypeScript

This example provides a Stream Deck+ dial action with a linear volume bar, percent text, mute cross, and smoothing.

Run:
1. npm install
   - Note: 'canvas' may require additional native build tools or prebuilt binaries on your OS.
2. npm run build
3. Use 'elgato dev' to run in development mode or 'elgato build' to package the plugin.

Notes:
- Replace the in-memory volume/mute state with your audio backend as needed.
- Tune renderSize to the Stream Deck+ expected device pixel resolution.
